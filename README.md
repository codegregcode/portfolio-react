# My Portfolio

This app was created using `npx create-react-app`

### Why Am I making this app/website?

I'm making this to create a nice online portfolio for my work, both code and music

### It uses:

- npm
- node.js
- HTML, CSS
- JS/JSX
- React
- React Router
- React Slick
- React Image Gallery
- Jest
- Firebase/Firestore

### Roadmap

5/6 - I've got the basic components for the site built, there's just a couple things I want to edit. The next two big things to finish are styling, and then I want to create an animation screen. I'm planning on working on this in the evenings and over the weekend, so I'm hoping that I'll get the styling done by the end of the week, so then I can start on animation on the weekend.
